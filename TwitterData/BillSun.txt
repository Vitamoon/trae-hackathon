This NVDA Kyber Midplane PCB is probably the most complex industry design of PCB i have ever seen. It will be used in Rubin generation to replace the old method that is not robust during shipment https://t.co/UowvTW0oui	3/19/2025, 5:17:38 PM

NVL 72 is gonna be one whole TEE GPU unit that can run one user’s future personal AI as a boost to user’s local device to run privacy preserving personal AI that is the really powerful (at least it can run around 1T size model) for each user on their personal data. https://t.co/IQmzGDou53	3/18/2025, 11:27:30 AM

Looking forward, clearly the biggest AI native asset is to bring unique data as tokenized assets. Ethena and Ondo just open door of classical triFi assets, but data is the AI native new assets to tokenize. https://t.co/9d0ZIy8bUZ	3/18/2025, 10:57:19 AM
